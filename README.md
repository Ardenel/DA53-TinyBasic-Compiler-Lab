# DA53-TinyBasic-Compiler-Lab

## Introduction
This project contains 3 labs work for the course DA53 Compiler Construction. The idea is to implement some elements of a Tiny Basic compiler.
The project are written in Java, and the code is organized in 3 packages:

- `LabSession - 1`: Lexical analysis by hand -> Write a Lexical Analyzer for Tiny Basic by hand composed of a Symbol Table, a Scanner, and a Lexer.
- `LabSession - 2`: Write the Tiny Basic Grammar, then a javaCC Parser, and finally the Syntax Analyzer.
- `LabSession - 3`: Use the LabSession - 2 as a base to implement the intermediate code generation (three-address code).

## How to run the project
To run the project, you need to have Java (JDK 22) installed on your machine. You can run the project by running the main method in the `Main` class in each package.

## Source
Multiple elements in this project have been written by Prof. Dr. Stéphane Galland, director of the CIAD Lab and teacher of the course DA53 from Université de Technologie de Belfort-Montbéliard.
